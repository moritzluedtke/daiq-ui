# DaiqUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.


## Ideas

- Snackbar, which announces the winners
- Correct Answer turns green when answer is revealed
- Questions can contain images from the web (they show the content in a link, so a direct link to the image in the web should be the input)
- (optional) When "reveal" is pressed all answers from the other participants are shown as tags/chips on the answers?
