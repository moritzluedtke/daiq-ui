# DaiqUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.


## Ideas

- Landing Page with "Create Question" and "Join Question"
  - "Create Question" leads to a custom url, under which the users can join the question (#angularRouter?) 
- Refactor backend code?
- Snackbar, which announces the winners
- Questions can contain images from the web (they show the content in a link, so a direct link to the image in the web
  should be the input)
- (optional) When "reveal" is pressed all answers from the other participants are shown as tags/chips on the answers? 

## Known issues

- One can enter an empty username if they clear the input and then exit the dialog via the `escape` key
- One can enter an empty answer in the admin panel by providing a whitespace
